## Fixing a Meta Tag to Use `property` Argument

[HTML standard](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/tag_meta.asp) states that the
argument for the meta tag name should be `name`:

```html
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML,CSS,XML,JavaScript" />
```

Some social networks require to use `property` argument instead (Facebook Open Graph).
MetaTags supports the most popular meta tags, but there will be tags that are not covered
by default. If you found one, and you feel like the community would benefit from
MetaTags supporting it out of the box, feel free to add it to [the list](https://github.com/kpumuk/meta-tags/blob/main/lib/meta_tags/configuration.rb#L23-L57)
and submit a pull request.
